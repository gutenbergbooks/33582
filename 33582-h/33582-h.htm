<h2>PHANTASMAGORIA.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>CANTO I.</h3>
<h4>The Trystyng.</h4>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>One winter night, at half-past nine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cold, tired, and cross, and muddy,</span><br />
I had come home, too late to dine,<br />
And supper, with cigars and wine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was waiting in the study.</span><br />
<br />
There was a strangeness in the room,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Something white and wavy</span><br />
Was standing near me in the gloom&mdash;<br />
<i>I</i> took it for the carpet-broom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Left by that careless slavey.</span></td></tr></table>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i014.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>But presently the Thing began<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To shiver and to sneeze:</span><br />
On which I said &#8220;Come, come, my man!<br />
That&#8217;s a most inconsiderate plan.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Less noise there, if you please!&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span><br />
&#8220;I&#8217;ve caught a cold,&#8221; the Thing replies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&#8220;Out there upon the landing.&#8221;</span><br />
I turned to look in some surprise,<br />
And there, before my very eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A little Ghost was standing!</span><br />
<br />
He trembled when he caught my eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And got behind a chair.</span><br />
&#8220;How came you here,&#8221; I said, &#8220;and why?<br />
I never saw a thing so shy.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come out! Don&#8217;t shiver there!&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
He said &#8220;I&#8217;d gladly tell you how,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And also tell you why;</span><br />
But&#8221; (here he gave a little bow)<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;re in so bad a temper now,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You&#8217;d think it all a lie.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;And as to being in a fright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Allow me to remark</span><br />
That Ghosts have just as good a right,<br />
In every way, to fear the light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As Men to fear the dark.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><br />
&#8220;No plea,&#8221; said I, &#8220;can well excuse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Such cowardice in you:</span><br />
For Ghosts can visit when they choose,<br />
Whereas we Humans ca&#8217;n&#8217;t refuse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To grant the interview.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
He said &#8220;A flutter of alarm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is not unnatural, is it?</span><br />
I really feared you meant some harm:<br />
But, now I see that you are calm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Let me explain my visit.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Houses are classed, I beg to state,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">According to the number</span><br />
Of Ghosts that they accommodate:<br />
(The Tenant merely counts as <i>weight</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With Coals and other lumber).</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;This is a &#8216;one-ghost&#8217; house, and you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When you arrived last summer,</span><br />
May have remarked a Spectre who<br />
Was doing all that Ghosts can do<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To welcome the new-comer.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><br />
&#8220;In Villas this is always done&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">However cheaply rented:</span><br />
For, though of course there&#8217;s less of fun<br />
When there is only room for one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ghosts have to be contented.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;That Spectre left you on the Third&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Since then you&#8217;ve not been haunted:</span><br />
For, as he never sent us word,<br />
&#8217;Twas quite by accident we heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That any one was wanted.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;A Spectre has first choice, by right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In filling up a vacancy;</span><br />
Then Phantom, Goblin, Elf, and Sprite&mdash;<br />
If all these fail them, they invite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The nicest Ghoul that they can see.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;The Spectres said the place was low,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And that you kept bad wine:</span><br />
So, as a Phantom had to go,<br />
And I was first, of course, you know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I couldn&#8217;t well decline.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br />
&#8220;No doubt,&#8221; said I, &#8220;they settled who<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was fittest to be sent:</span><br />
Yet still to choose a brat like you,<br />
To haunt a man of forty-two,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Was no great compliment!&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;I&#8217;m not so young, Sir,&#8221; he replied,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&#8220;As you might think. The fact is,</span><br />
In caverns by the water-side,<br />
And other places that I&#8217;ve tried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I&#8217;ve had a lot of practice:</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;But I have never taken yet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A strict domestic part,</span><br />
And in my flurry I forget<br />
The Five Good Rules of Etiquette<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We have to know by heart.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
My sympathies were warming fast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Towards the little fellow:</span><br />
He was so utterly aghast<br />
At having found a Man at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And looked so scared and yellow.</span></td></tr></table>

But pray sit down: you&#8217;ll feel inclined<br />

The Phantom shook his head and smiled.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&#8220;Consult them? Not a bit!</span><br />
&#8217;Twould be a job to drive one wild,<br />
To satisfy one single child&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There&#8217;d be no end to it!&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Of course you can&#8217;t leave <i>children</i> free,&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Said I, &#8220;to pick and choose:</span><br />
But, in the case of men like me,<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Allowed to state his views.&#8221;</span><br />

We visit for a single day,<br />
And whether then we go, or stay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Depends on circumstances.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;And, though we don&#8217;t consult &#8216;Mine Host&#8217;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Before the thing&#8217;s arranged,</span><br />
Still, if he often quits his post,<br />
Or is not a well-mannered Ghost,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Then you can have him changed.</span><br />

&#8220;Why, what has <i>that</i>,&#8221; said I, &#8220;to do<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><br />
&#8220;To trim&#8221; was not a phrase I could<br />

&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; I said, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be so good<br />

Lobster&mdash;and duck&mdash;and toasted cheese&mdash;<br />
If they don&#8217;t get an awful squeeze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I&#8217;m very much mistaken!</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;He is immensely fat, and so<br />

<h2>HIAWATHA&#8217;S PHOTOGRAPHING.</h2>

<p class="note">[In an age of imitation, I can claim no special merit for this slight
attempt at doing what is known to be so easy. Any fairly practised writer,
with the slightest ear for rhythm, could compose, for hours together, in
the easy running metre of &#8216;The Song of Hiawatha.&#8217; Having, then, distinctly
stated that I challenge no attention in the following little poem to its
merely verbal jingle, I must beg the candid reader to confine his
criticism to its treatment of the subject.]</p>

Took the camera of rosewood,<br />
Made of sliding, folding rosewood;<br />
Neatly put it all together.<br />
In its case it lay compactly,<br />
Folded into nearly nothing;<br />
But he opened out the hinges,<br />
Pushed and pulled the joints and hinges,<br />
Till it looked all squares and oblongs,<br />

Crouched beneath its dusky cover&mdash;<br />

Mystic, awful was the process.<br />

Looped about a massy pillar;<br />

Of a rosewood dining-table.<br />

Hold it firmly in his left-hand;<br />
He would keep his right-hand buried<br />
(Like Napoleon) in his waistcoat;<br />
He would contemplate the distance<br />
With a look of pensive meaning,<br />
As of ducks that die in tempests.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grand, heroic was the notion:</span><br />
Yet the picture failed entirely:<br />
Failed, because he moved a little,<br />
Moved, because he couldn&#8217;t help it.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Next, his better half took courage;</span><br />
She would have her picture taken.<br />
<i>She</i> came dressed beyond description,<br />
Dressed in jewels and in satin<br />
Far too gorgeous for an empress.</td></tr></table>

He suggested curves of beauty,<br />
Curves pervading all his figure,<br />
Which the eye might follow onward,<br />

All to the feet of one who stood<br />
Like maid enchanted in a wood,<br />
Frowning as darkly as she could.<br />

With huge umbrella, lank and brown,<br />
Unerringly she pinned it down,<br />
Right through the centre of the crown.<br />

Then, with an aspect cold and grim,<br />
Regardless of its battered rim,<br />
She took it up and gave it him.<br />
<br />
A while like one in dreams he stood,<br />
Then faltered forth his gratitude<br />
In words just short of being rude:<br />
<br />
For it had lost its shape and shine,<br />
And it had cost him four-and-nine,<br />
And he was going out to dine.</td></tr></table>

He, aiming blindly in the dark,<br />

Yet madly strove with might and main<br />
To get the upper hand again.<br />

Fixing her eyes upon the beach,<br />
As though unconscious of his speech,<br />
She said &#8220;Each gives to more than each.&#8221;<br />

He could not answer yea or nay:<br />
He faltered &#8220;Gifts may pass away.&#8221;<br />
Yet knew not what he meant to say.<br />

<h2>T&Egrave;MA CON VARIAZI&Oacute;NI.</h2>

<div class="note">
<p>[Why is it that Poetry has never yet been subjected to that process of
Dilution which has proved so advantageous to her sister-art Music? The
Diluter gives us first a few notes of some well-known Air, then a dozen
bars of his own, then a few more notes of the Air, and so on alternately:
thus saving the listener, if not from all risk of recognising the melody
at all, at least from the too-exciting transports which it might produce
in a more concentrated form. The process is termed &#8220;setting&#8221; by Composers,
and any one, that has ever experienced the emotion of being unexpectedly
set down in a heap of mortar, will recognise the truthfulness of this
happy phrase.</p>

<p>For truly, just as the genuine Epicure lingers lovingly over a morsel of
supreme Venison&mdash;whose every fibre seems to murmur &#8220;Excelsior!&#8221;&mdash;yet
swallows, ere returning to the toothsome dainty, great mouthfuls of
oatmeal-porridge and winkles: and just as the perfect Connoisseur in
Claret permits himself but one delicate sip, and then tosses off a pint or
more of boarding-school beer: so also&mdash;&mdash;</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Partook of the sublime.&#8217;</span><br />
Then tell me how! Don&#8217;t put me off<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With your &#8216;another time&#8217;!&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
The old man smiled to see him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hear his sudden sally;</span><br />
He liked the lad to speak his mind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enthusiastically;</span><br />
And thought &#8220;There&#8217;s no hum-drum in him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor any shilly-shally.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;And would you be a poet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before you&#8217;ve been to school?</span><br />
Ah, well! I hardly thought you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So absolute a fool.</span><br />
First learn to be spasmodic&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A very simple rule.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;For first you write a sentence,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then you chop it small;</span><br />
Then mix the bits, and sort them out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just as they chance to fall:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>The order of the phrases makes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No difference at all.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Then, if you&#8217;d be impressive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remember what I say,</span><br />
That abstract qualities begin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With capitals alway:</span><br />
The True, the Good, the Beautiful&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those are the things that pay!</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Next, when you are describing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A shape, or sound, or tint;</span><br />
Don&#8217;t state the matter plainly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But put it in a hint;</span><br />
And learn to look at all things<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a sort of mental squint.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;For instance, if I wished, Sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of mutton-pies to tell,</span><br />
Should I say &#8216;dreams of fleecy flocks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pent in a wheaten cell&#8217;?&#8221;</span><br />
&#8220;Why, yes,&#8221; the old man said: &#8220;that phrase<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would answer very well.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span><br />
&#8220;Then fourthly, there are epithets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That suit with any word&mdash;</span><br />
As well as Harvey&#8217;s Reading Sauce<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With fish, or flesh, or bird&mdash;</span><br />
Of these, &#8216;wild,&#8217; &#8216;lonely,&#8217; &#8216;weary,&#8217; &#8216;strange,&#8217;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are much to be preferred.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;And will it do, O will it do<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To take them in a lump&mdash;</span><br />
As &#8216;the wild man went his weary way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a strange and lonely pump&#8217;?&#8221;</span><br />
&#8220;Nay, nay! You must not hastily<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To such conclusions jump.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Such epithets, like pepper,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give zest to what you write;</span><br />
And, if you strew them sparely,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They whet the appetite:</span><br />
But if you lay them on too thick,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You spoil the matter quite!</span></td></tr></table>

<h2>THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK,</h2>
<h3>An Agony in Eight Fits.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="center">PREFACE.</p>

<p>If&mdash;and the thing is wildly possible&mdash;the charge of writing nonsense were
ever brought against the author of this brief but instructive poem, it
would be based, I feel convinced, on the line (in p. 144)</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:&#8221;</p>

<p>In view of this painful possibility, I will not (as I might) appeal
indignantly to my other writings as a proof that I am incapable of such a
deed: I will not (as I might) point to the strong moral purpose of this
poem itself, to the arithmetical principles so cautiously inculcated in
it, or to its noble teachings in Natural History&mdash;I will take the more
prosaic course of simply explaining how it happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>The Bellman, who was almost morbidly sensitive about appearances, used to
have the bowsprit unshipped once or twice a week to be revarnished; and it
more than once happened, when the time came for replacing it, that no one
on board could remember which end of the ship it belonged to. They knew it
was not of the slightest use to appeal to the Bellman about it&mdash;he would
only refer to his Naval Code, and read out in pathetic tones Admiralty
Instructions which none of them had ever been able to understand&mdash;so it
generally ended in its being fastened on, anyhow, across the rudder. The
helmsman<small><a name="f1.1" id="f1.1" href="#f1">[1]</a></small> used to stand by with tears in his eyes: <i>he</i> knew it was all
wrong, but alas! Rule 42 of the Code, &#8220;<i>No one shall speak to the Man at
the Helm</i>,&#8221; had been completed by the Bellman himself with the words &#8220;<i>and
the Man at the Helm shall speak to no one</i>.&#8221; So remonstrance was
impossible, and no steering could be done till the next varnishing day.
During these bewildering intervals the ship usually sailed backwards.</p>

<p>As this poem is to some extent connected with the lay of the Jabberwock,
let me take this opportunity of answering a question that has often been
asked me, how to pronounce &#8220;slithy toves.&#8221; The &#8220;i&#8221; in &#8220;slithy&#8221; is long, as
in &#8220;writhe&#8221;; and &#8220;toves&#8221; is pronounced so as to rhyme with &#8220;groves.&#8221;
Again, the first &#8220;o&#8221; in &#8220;borogoves&#8221; is pronounced like the &#8220;o&#8221; in
&#8220;borrow.&#8221; I have heard people try to give it the sound of the &#8220;o&#8221; in
&#8220;worry.&#8221; Such is Human Perversity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>This also seems a fitting occasion to notice the other hard words in that
poem. Humpty-Dumpty&#8217;s theory, of two meanings packed into one word like a
portmanteau, seems to me the right explanation for all.</p>

<p>For instance, take the two words &#8220;fuming&#8221; and &#8220;furious.&#8221; Make up your mind
that you will say both words, but leave it unsettled which you will say
first. Now open your mouth and speak. If your thoughts incline ever so
little towards &#8220;fuming,&#8221; you will say &#8220;fuming-furious&#8221;; if they turn, by
even a hair&#8217;s breadth towards &#8220;furious,&#8221; you will say &#8220;furious-fuming&#8221;;
but if you have that rarest of gifts, a perfectly balanced mind, you will
say &#8220;frumious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Supposing that, when Pistol uttered the well-known words&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">&#8220;Under which king, Bezonian? Speak or die!&#8221;</p>

<p>Justice Shallow had felt certain that it was either William or Richard,
but had not been able to settle which, so that he could not possibly say
either name before the other, can it be doubted that, rather than die, he
would have gasped out &#8220;Rilchiam!&#8221;</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But especially &#8220;Thing-um-a jig!&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He had different names from these:</span><br />
His intimate friends called him &#8220;Candle-ends,&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his enemies &#8220;Toasted-cheese.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;His form is ungainly&mdash;his intellect small&mdash;&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(So the Bellman would often remark)&mdash;</span><br />
&#8220;But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is the thing that one needs with a Snark.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
He would joke with hy&aelig;nas, returning their stare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With an impudent wag of the head:</span><br />
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Just to keep up its spirits,&#8221; he said.</span><br />
<br />
He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad&mdash;</span><br />
He could only bake Bride-cake&mdash;for which, I may state,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No materials were to be had.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span><br />
The last of the crew needs especial remark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though he looked an incredible dunce:</span><br />
He had just one idea&mdash;but, that one being &#8220;Snark,&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The good Bellman engaged him at once.</span><br />
<br />
He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the ship had been sailing a week,</span><br />
He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And was almost too frightened to speak:</span><br />
<br />
But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There was only one Beaver on board;</span><br />
And that was a tame one he had of his own,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose death would be deeply deplored.</span><br />
<br />
The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Protested, with tears in its eyes,</span><br />
That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Could atone for that dismal surprise!</span><br />
<br />
It strongly advised that the Butcher should be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conveyed in a separate ship:</span><br />
But the Bellman declared that would never agree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the plans he had made for the trip:</span></td></tr></table>

And he feared he must really decline, for his part,<br />

<br />
The Beaver&#8217;s best course was, no doubt, to procure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A second-hand dagger-proof coat&mdash;</span><br />
So the Baker advised it&mdash;and next, to insure<br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!</span><br />
Such solemnity, too! One could see he was wise,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The moment one looked in his face!</span><br />
<br />
He had bought a large map representing the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without the least vestige of land:</span><br />
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A map they could all understand.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;What&#8217;s the good of Mercator&#8217;s North Poles and Equators,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?&#8221;</span><br />

<tr><td>&#8220;Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But we&#8217;ve got our brave Captain to thank&#8221;</span><br />
(So the crew would protest) &#8220;that he&#8217;s bought <i>us</i> the best&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A perfect and absolute blank!&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
This was charming, no doubt: but they shortly found out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the Captain they trusted so well</span><br />
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that was to tingle his bell.</span><br />
<br />
He was thoughtful and grave&mdash;but the orders he gave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were enough to bewilder a crew.</span><br />
When he cried &#8220;Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What on earth was the helmsman to do?</span><br />
<br />
Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A thing, as the Bellman remarked,</span><br />
That frequently happens in tropical climes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When a vessel is, so to speak, &#8220;snarked.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>Said he <i>had</i> hoped, at least, when the wind blew due East,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the ship would <i>not</i> travel due West!</span><br />
<br />
But the danger was past&mdash;they had landed at last,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:</span><br />
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which consisted of chasms and crags.</span><br />
<br />
The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And repeated in musical tone</span><br />
Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the crew would do nothing but groan.</span><br />
<br />
He served out some grog with a liberal hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bade them sit down on the beach:</span><br />
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he stood and delivered his speech.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(They were all of them fond of quotations:</span><br />
So they drank to his health, and they gave him three cheers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While he served out additional rations).</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span><br />
&#8220;We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Four weeks to the month you may mark),</span><br />
But never as yet (&#8217;tis your Captain who speaks)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Seven days to the week I allow),</span><br />
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We have never beheld till now!</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The five unmistakable marks</span><br />
By which you may know, wheresoever you go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The warranted genuine Snarks.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:</span><br />
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a flavour of Will-o-the wisp.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Its habit of getting up late you&#8217;ll agree<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That it carries too far, when I say</span><br />
That it frequently breakfasts at five o&#8217;clock tea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And dines on the following day.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span><br />
&#8220;The third is its slowness in taking a jest.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should you happen to venture on one,</span><br />
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it always looks grave at a pun.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which it constantly carries about,</span><br />
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sentiment open to doubt.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;The fifth is ambition. It next will be right<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To describe each particular batch:</span><br />
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From those that have whiskers, and scratch.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet I feel it my duty to say</span><br />
Some are Boojums&mdash;&#8221; The Bellman broke off in alarm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For the Baker had fainted away.</span></td></tr></table>

<br />
When at length he sat up and was able to speak,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His sad story he offered to tell;</span><br />
And the Bellman cried &#8220;Silence! Not even a shriek!&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And excitedly tingled his bell.</span><br />
<br />
There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scarcely even a howl or a groan,</span><br />
As the man they called &#8220;Ho!&#8221; told his story of woe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In an antediluvian tone.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span><br />
&#8220;My father and mother were honest, though poor&mdash;&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;Skip all that!&#8221; cried the Bellman in haste.</span><br />
&#8220;If it once becomes dark, there&#8217;s no chance of a Snark&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We have hardly a minute to waste!&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;I skip forty years,&#8221; said the Baker, in tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;And proceed without further remark</span><br />
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To help you in hunting the Snark.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remarked, when I bade him farewell&mdash;&#8221;</span><br />
&#8220;Oh, skip your dear uncle!&#8221; the Bellman exclaimed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he angrily tingled his bell.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;He remarked to me then,&#8221; said that mildest of men,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;&#8216;If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:</span><br />
Fetch it home by all means&mdash;you may serve it with greens<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it&#8217;s handy for striking a light.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;&#8216;You may seek it with thimbles&mdash;and seek it with care;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You may hunt it with forks and hope;</span><br />
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You may charm it with smiles and soap&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><br />
(&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly the method,&#8221; the Bellman bold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a hasty parenthesis cried,</span><br />
&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly the way I have always been told<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the capture of Snarks should be tried!&#8221;)</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;&#8216;But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If your Snark be a Boojum! For then</span><br />
You will softly and suddenly vanish away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never be met with again!&#8217;</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When I think of my uncle&#8217;s last words:</span><br />
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brimming over with quivering curds!</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;It is this, it is this&mdash;&#8221; &#8220;We have had that before!&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Bellman indignantly said.</span><br />
And the Baker replied &#8220;Let me say it once more.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is this, it is this that I dread!</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;I engage with the Snark&mdash;every night after dark&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a dreamy delirious fight:</span><br />
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,<br />

&#8220;We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,<br />

&#8220;It&#8217;s excessively awkward to mention it now&mdash;<br />

&#8220;You may charge me with murder&mdash;or want of sense&mdash;<br />

But the slightest approach to a false pretence<br />

<tr><td>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They pursued it with forks and hope;</span><br />
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They charmed it with smiles and soap.</span><br />
<br />
Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For making a separate sally;</span><br />
And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A dismal and desolate valley.</span><br />
<br />
But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It had chosen the very same place:</span><br />
Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The disgust that appeared in his face.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span><br />
Each thought he was thinking of nothing but &#8220;Snark&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the glorious work of the day;</span><br />
And each tried to pretend that he did not remark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the other was going that way.</span><br />
<br />
But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the evening got darker and colder,</span><br />
Till (merely from nervousness, not from good will)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They marched along shoulder to shoulder.</span><br />
<br />
Then a scream, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they knew that some danger was near:</span><br />
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And even the Butcher felt queer.</span><br />
<br />
He thought of his childhood, left far far behind&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That blissful and innocent state&mdash;</span><br />
The sound so exactly recalled to his mind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A pencil that squeaks on a slate!</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;&#8217;Tis the voice of the Jubjub!&#8221; he suddenly cried.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(This man, that they used to call &#8220;Dunce.&#8221;)</span><br />
&#8220;As the Bellman would tell you,&#8221; he added with pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;I have uttered that sentiment once.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span><br />
&#8220;&#8217;Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You will find I have told it you twice.</span><br />
&#8217;Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If only I&#8217;ve stated it thrice.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Attending to every word:</span><br />
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the third repetition occurred.</span><br />
<br />
It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It had somehow contrived to lose count,</span><br />
And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By reckoning up the amount.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Two added to one&mdash;if that could but be done,&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It said, &#8220;with one&#8217;s fingers and thumbs!&#8221;</span><br />
Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It had taken no pains with its sums.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;The thing can be done,&#8221; said the Butcher, &#8220;I think.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The thing must be done, I am sure.</span><br />
The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The best there is time to procure.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span><br />
The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And ink in unfailing supplies:</span><br />
While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And watched them with wondering eyes.</span><br />
<br />
So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he wrote with a pen in each hand,</span><br />
And explained all the while in a popular style<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which the Beaver could well understand.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Taking Three as the subject to reason about&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A convenient number to state&mdash;</span><br />
We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By One Thousand diminished by Eight.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;The result we proceed to divide, as you see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By Nine-Hundred-and-Ninety-and-Two:</span><br />
Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exactly and perfectly true.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;The method employed I would gladly explain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While I have it so clear in my head,</span><br />
If I had but the time and you had but the brain&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But much yet remains to be said.</span></td></tr></table>

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A Lesson in Natural History.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
In his genial way he proceeded to say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Forgetting all laws of propriety,</span><br />
And that giving instruction, without introduction,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),</span><br />

&#8220;As to temper the Jubjub&#8217;s a desperate bird,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since it lives in perpetual passion:</span><br />
Its taste in costume is entirely absurd&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is ages ahead of the fashion:</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;But it knows any friend it has met once before:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It never will look at a bribe:</span><br />
And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And collects&mdash;though it does not subscribe.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:</span><br />
(Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some, in mahogany kegs:)</span><br />

&#8220;You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You condense it with locusts and tape:</span><br />
Still keeping one principal object in view&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To preserve its symmetrical shape.&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But he felt that the Lesson must end,</span><br />
And he wept with delight in attempting to say<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He considered the Beaver his friend:</span><br />
<br />
While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More eloquent even than tears,</span><br />
It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would have taught it in seventy years.</span><br />
<br />
They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(For a moment) with noble emotion,</span><br />
Said &#8220;This amply repays all the wearisome days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We have spent on the billowy ocean!&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have seldom if ever been known;</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You could never meet either alone.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span><br />
And when quarrels arose&mdash;as one frequently finds<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour&mdash;</span><br />
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And cemented their friendship for ever!</span></td></tr></table>

Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That his fancy had dwelt on so long.</span><br />
<br />
He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,</span><br />
Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the charge of deserting its sty.</span></td></tr></table>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the sty was deserted when found:</span><br />
And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In a soft under-current of sound.</span><br />
<br />
The indictment had never been clearly expressed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And it seemed that the Snark had begun,</span><br />
And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What the pig was supposed to have done.</span><br />
<br />
The Jury had each formed a different view<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Long before the indictment was read),</span><br />
And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One word that the others had said.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;You must know&mdash;&#8221; said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed &#8220;Fudge!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That statute is obsolete quite!</span><br />
Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On an ancient manorial right.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;In the matter of Treason the pig would appear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To have aided, but scarcely abetted:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If you grant the plea &#8216;never indebted.&#8217;</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;The fact of Desertion I will not dispute:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But its guilt, as I trust, is removed</span><br />
(So far as relates to the costs of this suit)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the Alibi which has been proved.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;My poor client&#8217;s fate now depends on your votes.&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here the speaker sat down in his place,</span><br />
And directed the Judge to refer to his notes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And briefly to sum up the case.</span><br />
<br />
But the Judge said he never had summed up before;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So the Snark undertook it instead,</span><br />
And summed it so well that it came to far more<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than the Witnesses ever had said!</span><br />
<br />
When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the word was so puzzling to spell;</span><br />
But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn&#8217;t mind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Undertaking that duty as well.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span><br />
So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It was spent with the toils of the day:</span><br />
When it said the word &#8220;GUILTY!&#8221; the Jury all groaned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some of them fainted away.</span><br />
<br />
Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Too nervous to utter a word:</span><br />
When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the fall of a pin might be heard.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Transportation for life&#8221; was the sentence it gave,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8220;And <i>then</i> to be fined forty pound.&#8221;</span><br />
The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That the phrase was not legally sound.</span><br />
<br />
But their wild exultation was suddenly checked<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the jailer informed them, with tears,</span><br />
Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the pig had been dead for some years.</span><br />
<br />
The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But the Snark, though a little aghast,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went bellowing on to the last.</span><br />
<br />
Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To grow every moment more clear:</span><br />
Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.</span></td></tr></table>

<h2>FOUR RIDDLES.</h2>

<div class="note">
<p>[These consist of two Double Acrostics and two Charades.</p>

<p>No. I. was written at the request of some young friends, who had gone to a
ball at an Oxford Commemoration&mdash;and also as a specimen of what might be
done by making the Double Acrostic <i>a connected poem</i> instead of what it
has hitherto been, a string of disjointed stanzas, on every conceivable
subject, and about as interesting to read straight through as a page of a
Cyclop&aelig;dia. The first two stanzas describe the two main words, and each
subsequent stanza one of the cross &#8220;lights.&#8221;</p>

<p>No. II. was written after seeing Miss Ellen Terry perform in the play of
&#8220;Hamlet.&#8221; In this case the first stanza describes the two main words.</p>

<p>No. III. was written after seeing Miss Marion Terry perform in Mr.
Gilbert&#8217;s play of &#8220;Pygmalion and Galatea.&#8221; The three stanzas respectively
describe &#8220;My First,&#8221; &#8220;My Second,&#8221; and &#8220;My Whole.&#8221;]</p></div>

<span style="margin-left: 6em;">For just a little while!&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
A change came o&#8217;er my Vision&mdash;it was night:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We clove a pathway through a frantic throng:</span><br />
The steeds, wild-plunging, filled us with affright:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">The chariots whirled along.</span><br />
<br />
Within a marble hall a river ran&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A living tide, half muslin and half cloth:</span><br />
And here one mourned a broken wreath or fan,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Yet swallowed down her wrath;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span><br />
And here one offered to a thirsty fair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(His words half-drowned amid those thunders tuneful)</span><br />
Some frozen viand (there were many there),<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">A tooth-ache in each spoonful.</span><br />
<br />
There comes a happy pause, for human strength<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will not endure to dance without cessation;</span><br />
And every one must reach the point at length<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Of absolute prostration.</span><br />
<br />
At such a moment ladies learn to give,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To partners who would urge them over-much,</span><br />
A flat and yet decided negative&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Photographers love such.</span><br />
<br />
There comes a welcome summons&mdash;hope revives,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fading eyes grow bright, and pulses quicken:</span><br />
Incessant pop the corks, and busy knives<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Dispense the tongue and chicken.</span><br />
<br />
Flushed with new life, the crowd flows back again:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all is tangled talk and mazy motion&mdash;</span><br />
Much like a waving field of golden grain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Or a tempestuous ocean.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span><br />
And thus they give the time, that Nature meant<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For peaceful sleep and meditative snores,</span><br />
To ceaseless din and mindless merriment<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">And waste of shoes and floors.</span><br />
<br />
And One (we name him not) that flies the flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That dreads the dances, and that shuns the salads,</span><br />
They doom to pass in solitude the hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">Writing acrostic-ballads.</span><br />
<br />
How late it grows! The hour is surely past<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That should have warned us with its double-knock?</span><br />
The twilight wanes, and morning comes at last&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">&#8220;Oh, Uncle, what&#8217;s o&#8217;clock?&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
The Uncle gravely nods, and wisely winks.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It <i>may</i> mean much, but how is one to know?</span><br />
He opes his mouth&mdash;yet out of it, methinks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">No words of wisdom flow.</span></td></tr></table>
